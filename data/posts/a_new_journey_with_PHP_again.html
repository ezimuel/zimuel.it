<post date="2019-03-14" img="background_elastic.jpg" title="A new journey with PHP, again!" sub="">

<p>I spent my last 11 years working for <a href="http://www.zend.com/">Zend Technologies</a> contributing to <a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> with the open source projects <a href="https://apigility.org/">Apigility</a>, <a href="https://getexpressive.org">Expressive</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Cloud_API">Simple Cloud API</a> and <a href="https://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a>.</p>

<p>During this period, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/ezimuel">hundreds of thousands lines of code</a>, I provided consultancy for enterprise companies around the world, I presented <a href="https://www.zimuel.it/conferences">70+ talks</a> in international conferences across 15 countries, I wrote <a href="https://www.zimuel.it/books">3 books</a> about PHP and Javascript and I co-founded the <a href="http://torino.grusp.org/">PHP User Group of Turin</a> (Italy), which today has 100+ participants.</p>


<p>I had been very lucky to achieve all these goals! I have to thanks all my colleagues in Zend and all the PHP community. It has been an amazing period, I learned a lot working with an incredible team of people like <a href="https://mwop.net/">Matthew Weier O'Phinney</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeev_Suraski">Zeev Suraski</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dstogov">Dmitry Stogov</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adamculp">Adam Culp</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/slavey-karadzhov-2951674/">Slavey Karadzhov</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Gutmans">Andi Gutmans</a> (now in AWS) and more.</p>

<p>Some months ago, I wrote about the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-zend-framework-enrico-zimuel/">future of Zend Framework</a>. There are some big news coming in the next weeks. There will be a (new) future for the Framework and other related projects and I'll continue to contribute, as volunteer. Stay tuned!</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/img/post/elastic_logo.jpg" alt="Elastic" /></p>

<p>That said, here the big news for me. I'm very happy to announce that starting from next Monday (March 18), I'll join <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elastic</a> as <i>Principal Software Engineer</i>. I'll be responsible for the PHP libraries of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> and other products.</p>
<p>This means, I'll continue to work in the open source business and I'll continue to develop in PHP (mainly).</p>

<p>I'm very excited and honored to join Elastic, a <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/why-open-source">100% open source company</a> and I feel lucky to remain in the PHP community, continuing to focus on open source.</p>
<p>This is a new journey for me but somehow I feel already at home!</p>
