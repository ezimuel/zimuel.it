<p><i>Update:</i> strarting from PHP 5.6 you can use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php">password_hash()</a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php">password_verify()</a> to store user's password. They use bcrypt as default algorithm.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago I presented the talk "Password (in)security, how to generate and store passwords in a secure way" during the  <a href="http://moca.olografix.org/" target="_blank">Metro Olografix CAmp (MOCA)</a>  in Pescara (Italy). MOCA is an italian hacker camp inspired by the north european camp like the <a href="http://events.ccc.de/camp" target="_blank">Chaos Communication Camp</a>.</p>

<p>You can find the slides of the presentation here:</p>

<p>During the talk I tried to give an answer to the problem of how to generate and store a user's password in a secure way. I discussed the problem from the point of view of a user that have to generate  a password, that should be "robust" and easy to remember, and from the point of view of a developer than must store the user's password somewhere and wants to be sure that no one can access to the content, not even the administrator of the system.</p>

<p>I discussed of some recent passwords attacks to some famous web site like Linkedin, Yahoo, Last.fm, etc. I showed how to apply a brute force attack using the power of GPUs and how is easy to attack passwords stored using MD5/SHA1 with or without a salt value. I introduced the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2" target="_blank">Pbkdf2</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt" target="_blank">bcrypt</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt" target="_blank">scrypt</a> algorithms that can be used to store a user's password with a good security level. I showed some examples of usage using the PHP scripting language.</p>

<p>If you are a PHP developer I suggest to have a look to the open source component <strong>zend-crypt</strong> of the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> project that supports all the mentioned algorithms.</p>
